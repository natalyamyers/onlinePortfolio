        <h1>Natalya Myers Portfolio</h1>
        <p>This semester in DIGIT210, me and a team of students took a text document of Grimm's Brothers fairy tales and tagged all of the colors, numbers, and animals mentioned to create SVG graphs of those most used. You can find the page of our work and analysis <a href= "https://stf5123.github.io/Grimm_project/">here</a>.</p>
